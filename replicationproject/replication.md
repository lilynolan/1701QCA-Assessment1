# Assessment 1: Replication project

*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
Banana Keyboard


### Related project 1 ###
Tickle Me Elmo

This project is related to mine because it invloves button pushing with simple reactions from the toy. Tickle Me Elmo has a few different sounds and movements programmed for when buttons on the toy are pressed. Similar to mine the lemon is a button that makes a noise when preed and has a few different set noises.


### Related project 2 ###
Pixel Pyros

This project is related to mine because it invloves an interactive touch. The auience can interact with the projected image without any instruction. Any kind of touch on the wall will produce a reaction in the projection.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before: Before reading this I would always feel silly for interacting with something wrong. A common example described in the reading is doors and how they can be misleading. A door that has a handle on it which signifies pull when the door is in fact meant to be pushed had always left me feeling frustrated for using the appliance wrong.

*What I learned: I learnt that it is not the users fault for using an appliance wrong. If a signifier does not clearly communicate the affordance then the person using said product has to revert to trial and error to figure out how it works. Such as with a door that has the wrong signifier, the frustration of pulling and then having to push could be avoided by having a better signifier.

*What I would like to know more about: I'd like to learn more about hidden signifiers that we follow every day without noticing.

*How this relates to the project I am working on: My project has a very simple affordance which is to make a noise when the button is triggered. Currently it does not have any signifiers so if someone was to try and use it they probably wouldn't be able to figure out it's function.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: That microinteractions were things that you barely noticed

*What I learned: Microinteractions can make up every part of an electronic device or app. Whether there is only one interaction or a thousand each one on be the reason

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*
I felt that my project was successful in replicating the task and in putting a bit more creativity to the banana keyboard. I feel that the presentation could have been improved. The wires were messy and the joins were flimsy. If I was to create this again I would wrap wires around each connection so that they are more secure and tape them down so that there aren't any loose wires. 

*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
Another context that this project could be used for is education. This project demonstrates the flow of electricity through various objects and materials. I think that this experiment could be used as a teaching tool for how circuts work, conductivity and codeing.
