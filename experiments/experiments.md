This was my fisrt ever experience with coding and using a mirobit. It was fun to get a first insight into how coding works with this simple exercise.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).

#### Reflection ####

This experiment was interesting because I used Javascrispt instead of the blocks to write the code. I found Javascript more challenging than the blocks but I can see that with experience you would be able to write code much faster with Java than with the blocks.
